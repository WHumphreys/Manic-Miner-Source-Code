# Manic Miner ZX Spectrum Source Code
A Disassembly of Manic Miner for the ZX Spectrum.

This isn't the original source code written by Matthew Smith.   
 
It is a disassembly created by William Humphreys of an original binary with a lot of useful help and changes by Simon Brattel. 

It has been created specifically to be assembled with the:

Zeus Z80 Assembler / Disassembler / Emulator developed by Simon Brattel.

Initially I just wanted to see how the game I played as a young child with one of my first home computers had been constructed. 

After much searching on Google and many downloads I couldn't find a version (true to the original) that actually compiled. So I decided to create one.

Manic Miner I'm assuming is still owned by Matthew Smith.

As there seems to be no way to contact him I'm making the assumption that if he sees this and wants it removed he will contact me and I will be happy to do so.
